		<h1>Lionel Messi</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Lionel Messi is a soccer player who has led Barcelona to Champions League, La Liga and Spanish Club titles. By the age of 21, Messi had received Ballon d’Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations. Lionel Messi is the heir apparent to the throne left vacant by Diego Armando Maradona. The waters are divided between those who consider him to be far from being the best No. 10 and those who believe that Messi will be even better than Maradona. Born in Rosario, he cut his teeth in the youth ranks of Newell’s Old Boys, until a hormonal problem that affected his growth changed the plans of his family and, of course, his personal future. Facing expensive treatment for their son, Messi’s parents moved to Spain as Newell’s were not able to afford the medical costs related to his condition, and even the wealthiest Argentine teams, such as River Plate, refused to foot the bill. After his first trial with Barcelona, the Catalan coaches had no doubts. They decided to sign Messi and pay for his medical treatment. His growth was noticeable within Barca, and in the little time, he came to be considered one of the great talents at the club. He made his debut in the first division in October 2004, against Espanyol, and Barcelona has since adopted him as one of their greatest idols.
